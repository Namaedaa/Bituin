  name: Halcyon blaster
  description: An energy handgun that utilizes Halcyon, as it turns out, can also
    be used for destructive purposes. Halcyon blasters were once used by the Great
    City of Azoth's enforcers and military might. With how powerful Halycon can be,
    ATO-333 is the most destructive Ancient Machine of Old, as he can generate almost
    an infinite amount of energy but also has the lowest intellect of all of them.
