  sentence:
  - Okay, with all the movement, I'm pretty sure I got no broken bones from that
    crash.
  - And I have no broken wires.
  - Heh. Good one.
  - Anyway, do you know where we are?
  - Yes. We are currently in the Ruined City of Azoth.
  - The Ruined City of Azoth... huh.
  - Yup. What was once the most technologically advanced city, the Great City of
    Azoth, was destroyed by the greed of men.
  - Hm, I kind of remember this. Didn't the people of Azoth pissed off a Machine
    God?
  - Codenamed ATO-333, an Ancient Machine of Old, and no, the people of Azoth did
    not just 'piss it off'.
  - As I said, it was greed. They got more than they bargained for. They basically
    destroyed this city themselves.
  - And now ATO-333 has made these ruins his home, and his sentries roam and act
    as his eyes for him.
  - (For some reason, he did not exactly say what the people of Azoth did.)
  - I see, thanks for the history lesson.
  - By the way Amelia, I can detect the location of the trace of Thomas but we need
    a map of this city so we can actually pinpoint it.
  - Gotcha, let's go find one.
