  sentence:
  - Damn, that crash busted my ship pretty badly.
  - I wonder if there's any materials and parts here I can gather to repair my ship.
  - .....
  - Hmm- Hey you! You little robot!
  - Hello. I am-
  - Don't you hello me! You nearly got me killed!
  - Forgive me, I forced a boot-up because I detected a trace of Thomas here.
  - That doesn't- Wait, you said Thomas, as in Thomas Perry? My father?
  - Yes. Hello again, Amelia Perry. I am P0-91, and I am to help you find your father.
  - .....
  - (I do not know what he is or what his motives are, but this is probably my best
    lead yet to finding my father.)
  - Okay P0-91, I'll hold you to your word. Let's go find my father.
  - All right, let's go have a look around.
  - Right behind you.
