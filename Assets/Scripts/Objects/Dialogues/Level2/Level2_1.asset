  sentence:
  - That's a lot of sentries; I wonder how we would get past those?
  - That should not be a problem; I have something that can help us.
  - You do? What is it?
  - I have a camouflage module. We can blend in the environment, and those sentries
    will not see us.
  - Awesome!
  - Wait, why didn't you tell me earlier?
  - You never asked.
